Notes on stuff to setup for dad:
1. Stock sheet - to input stock items, pricing, etc. I made a basic Google sheet, he hasn't used it yet. Need to find out why.
2. KISS - find out how he is use to working, make new system similar. Better support panel, he mustn't be afraid to ask for help or be scared by the tech stuff.
3. Test stuff on Firefox browser, this is what he uses.
4. See if I can make a new toolbar for him with all the stuff he needs, or perhaps if I create a firefox login for him, set everything up, and then he logs in, will it show the new setups/shortcuts?
5. FLOCK.com - use this? In stead of Slack?

To make:

Stock
Simple stock card system, basic input screens feeding into MySQL DB 
Inputs - item code, descr, qty, price
Lookup/Display - like old manual stock card system - 2 sides - stock in, stock out, recon qty on hand

Customers 
Basic invoice screen, pulling data from main DB
Basic input for customer info
Pull customer statement,
enter payments received

Suppliers
Basic PO / GRV/invoice screen, pulling data from main DB
Basic input for supplier info
Pull supplier statement,
enter payments made, discount received

Basic Cashbook screen

All based on manual layouts - nothing too fancy

Nice to do:
Build a helpbot
